What did you like about this project?

I like that it uses everything that has been taught up till this point. 


What did you struggle with in this project?
The time limit has made me more anxious. The anxiety caused me to not be able to think properly. Logics that i have i learned and practise were forgotten. Compiling multiple different elements into concepts i have known and done had thrown me off course and made me not use the time allocated efficiently. 

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Think it would have been better to split the assessment apart. So that we can break it down easier. Time management is an issue as well. Coding consecutively and trying to figure out the errors in a 6-7 straight is really taxing on my mental capacity.
